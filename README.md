Living Word is a party-focused turn-based RPG inspired by the works of Rick Riordan and by religion as a cultural phenomenon. Traditional RPG classes are replaced by various belief systems and their deities/sects and Devotion levels that recontextualize the use of abilities. Combat twists like positional party setup remain minimal as most of the new complexity leans into character growth mechanics.
